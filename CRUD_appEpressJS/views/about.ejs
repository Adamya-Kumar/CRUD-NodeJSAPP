        What is CRUD in Express JS?
    </h1>
    <div class="data">
        <p>ExpressJS is a popular open-source web application framework that allows developers to easily implement CRUD
            (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality in web applications.</p>

        <p> to the powerful routing system and middleware support of expressJS, developers can define routes to handle
            each CRUD operation and interact with the database or any other data source through an ORM or data access
            library. For example, the framework provides built-in methods such as app. get(), app. post(), app. put(),
            and
            app. delete() to handle HTTP requests for reading, creating, updating, and deleting data respectively. These
            methods can be used to define routes that map to specific CRUD operations, making it easy to build RESTful
            APIs
            and web applications that interact with a database or other data sources. With its flexibility, scalability,
            and
            ease of use, ExpressJS is an excellent choice for developers who want to implement CRUD functionality in
            their
            web applications. These operations correspond to the HTTP methods of POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE
            respectively.</p>

        <p> Here's a brief overview of what each operation does:</p>

        <p>Create (POST): This operation is used to create a new resource in the database. In Express, you can use the
            app.
            post() method to handle POST requests.</p>

        <p> Read (GET): This operation is used to retrieve data from the database. In Express, you can use the app.
            get()
            method to handle GET requests.</p>

        <p> Update (PUT/PATCH): This operation is used to modify an existing resource in the database. In Express, you
            can
            use the app. put() or app. patch() method to handle PUT/PATCH requests.</p>

        <p> Delete (DELETE): This operation is used to remove a resource from the database. In Express, you can use the
            app.
            delete() method to handle DELETE requests.</p>

        <p> By implementing these operations in your Express application, you can perform basic database operations and
            create a RESTful API that can be consumed by clients.</p>
